# How the spreadsheet was created.
This spreadsheet was created by a panel of five very experienced practitioners.  The goal was to capture their experience and create a state-of-art SIEM RFP that is specific to Indian Govt. and Company needs.  As the spreadsheet gets used, we expect comments and issues filed by the users.  These will be used and also learnings from SIEM providers to keep this spreadsheet updated so that it stays cutting edge.

Based on this, if you the user, are creating a new RFP, please download and use the latest version from here to ensure you have the latest.

# Using the spreadsheet
* Download the spreadsheet.  It has two main sheets: "SIEM Technical Specifications" and "SIEM Service Specifications".  You should add your own specifications relevant to your RFP to these sheets.  You should:
* _Mandatorily_ update the Sr. No, Category, Specification and Criticality columsn with your specifications.
* Copy any existing cells (from previous specifications) from column E, F & G.  This will allow the formating and formulae from the previous cells for the specification you have set up.
* You should also set the colums A, B, C, D & G as read-only so that data in these columns are not inadvertently modified.
* Once done, you can share this spreadsheet with the Vendors quoting for the RFP.
* The vendors should fill up columns E & F only.  The marks in G are automatically generated.  Once filled out, the vendors should share the updated spreadsheet back.
* The marks then can be used to decide upon the vendor who will finally deliver the product.
